# Two dots
## KyivAIGroup, September 2018

Consider one-dimesional discrete world of size $N$. The state is $x_i=0, i=1:N$.
Two dots $x_j=1, x_k=1,  j,k=some ~ numbers $.The distance between dots is d=|j-k|.
There is a teaching signal that activates neuron z for some distances. 

1)z=1 if $d=50$

2)z=1 if $45<d<55$

3) z=1 if $ 50<d<N$



It is a binary recognition and the solution should follow the creationism principle.
